# Data_structure
Notepad is an indispensable part of life. We often use undo and redo in our notebooks, so we need a good data structure to shorten the running time. In our final project, we use Stack and Linked list to implement in undo and redo. The data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
